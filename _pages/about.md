Hi there!

I am Abigail Peña Alejos, a versatile and multilingual professional with a rich background in international relations, public policy, and data science. Originally from Peru, my academic journey began at the [Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod](http://eng.unn.ru/) in Russia, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in International Relations and Diplomacy. Building on this foundation, I pursued a Master of Public Policy at the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in Berlin, Germany, where I deepened my expertise in statistical modeling, causal inference, and data science.Throughout my career, I have developed a deep passion for using data-driven insights to address complex social issues, particularly in the realms of governance, political inequality, and education.
